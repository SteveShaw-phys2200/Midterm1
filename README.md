##Midterm 1
###Main program found in **_Midterm1.c_**
###Note improvements to *makefile*

####Aim of the project:
1. implement Leibniz series to compute pi to error in 10^-6 range
1. implement BBP series to compute pi to error in 10^-6 range
1. run both programs several times to accurately measure time of computation of prog
1. compare the efficiency of computing the leibniz series vs. BBP series
