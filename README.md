##Midterm 1
###Main program found in **_Midterm1.c_**
* Note improvements to *makefile*
* Note improvements to *pi_bbp.c*
  * BBP runs twice as fast now

####Aim of the project:
1. implement Leibniz series to compute pi to error in 10^-6 range
1. implement BBP series to compute pi to error in 10^-6 range
1. run both programs several times to accurately measure time of computation of prog
1. compare the efficiency of computing the leibniz series vs. BBP series

####Answers to Midterm I Programing Project:
